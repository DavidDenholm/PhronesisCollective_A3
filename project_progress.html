						<b><h2>Week 1 Diary (17-23 Jan 2022)</h2></b>
					</center>
					<p>It is exciting to reconvene after a short rest from A2 submission. Everyone felt proud of our last achievement, yet we knew there were lots of gaps to fill for A3 and A5. 
					<br>We tried to work strategically and diligently as we were aware of how much there was to still achieve. </p>
					<p>Peta and Stephen worked together to remind the team of the question Smarter Gifter will answer. We then began to move forward from our conceptual plan. </p>
					<p>We learnt about UI wire framing and decided on the functions and features of Smarter Gifter. This exercise surely helped us to focus and become specific in what we wanted from our app. 
					<br>Our vision became focused, and the concepts began to fall into place. </p>

						<b><h2>Week 2 Diary (24-30 Jan 2022)</h2></b>
					</center>
					<p>Phronesis Collective made meaningful progress as members moved from the conceptual stage to planning stage. </p>
					<p>It started with low-fidelity wireframing UI of Smarter Gifter to help members focus on functions and features of the app. This included looking at features like login page, account creation, forgotten password, member profile page with navigation functions e.g., menu/logout/search/giftee list/product reviews, etc. </p>
					<p>From there we created giftee page with importing/creating image functions. All these helped us to confirm that the first version of our mob app will be SaaS, and this decision helped defined our scope of development and further planning, focusing on frontend (UI) and backend (integrating with external sources) of the app and database. 
					<br>Certainly, privacy and security are our core concerns and further investigation, both from I.T. and legal prospective, is needed to help our understanding and decisions. </p>
					<p>In parallel, Phronesis Collective members also preparing our A5 draft storyboard and presentation.

						<b><h2>Week 3 Diary (31 Jan-06 Feb 2022)</h2></b>
					</center>
					<p>This week was the most critical week as our goal was to deep-dive into our ideas. </p>
					<p>We started to discuss different views and ideas of the project. The way we saw Smarter Gifter was starting to mature. </p>
					<p>In Week 1 we felt somewhat lost, despite having a clear concept of the project. We did not know where to start other than with brainstorming. </p>
					<p>This week we started to understand what we should be looking for, what and how to compare, and how the information related back to the original question. 
					<br>For example, researching database options for Smarter Gifter made us realize that we need to intimately know our data, especially if we were to grow and expand our scopes to include online chats, store images, URL links. We may need NoSQL system such as MongoDB. This is only the tip of the iceberg. </p>
					<p>Similarly, learning about recent examples of cybersecurity attacks assisted us with considering our programming.</p>

					<p>We started to explore the costing of building a mobile app and source of revenue from pay-per-click, when we tried to build a business model for Smarter Gifter. We discovered that the development cost can become high with programming for impressive functions. </p>
					<p>At this stage, cost control is essential. Learning the costing of online advertisements for business vendors from pay-per-click and earnings-per-click help us to find our potential competitive strength.</p>
					<p>We agreed to focus on our first app version and finalise the standard and core essential functions in mid-Week 3 (yet allow scope for potential further development) but allow flexibility to make important changes to the project. We then began to firm our development schedule, prepare the video presentation, produce as many parts of the artifact as we were capable of, estimate costings and other technical details. </p>
					<p>This week also saw a discussion around ‘scope creep’, what we should and should not include. Limitations around budgeting, knowledge, and exposure, and security concerns kept a lid on what was and was not possible for Smarter Gifter.</p>

						<b><h2>Week 4 Diary (07 Feb-13 Feb 2022)</h2></b>
					</center>
					<p>We started consolidating our conceptual project by brainstorming ideas of functions and features of Smarter Gifter and used a few pages of low-fidelity UI wireframes to focus our thoughts and think logically: what should be vs want to be in there. </p>
					<p>We considered IaaS, PaaS and SaaS types of cloud service offerings, analyzed our capabilities and chose SaaS as our reference model for our app development. </p>
					<p>In the early stages we focused on privacy and security, closely followed by user interaction and experience. We reviewed and refined our models, considered user login with conventional username and password, using Google and/or facebook accounts, any age criteria for both users and their guest in the profile, using avatar vs real images, storing user account information in their own smartphones or in our cloud database server, how to notify our users of suitable products/services, featuring a calendar with pop-up reminders. </p>
					<p>We also reviewed product categories to be included/excluded for our prototypes. 
					<br>We agreed to spare some gift save others for future version. 
					<br>We then explored various technologies for our app, as well as financial aspects. We learnt also there is an established 5-stages mobile app development process.  </p>
					<p>We benchmarked our progress against this industrial standard and are glad to find that we are not deviated too far from it. </p>
					<p>We re-calibrated our plan and progress with this 5-stages process:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Analysis and planning </li>
							<li>UX and UI Design </li>
							<li>Mobile App Development </li>
							<li>Pre-Launch App Testing and Quality Assurance </li>
							<li>Ongoing maintenance and updates </li>
						</ul>

					</center>
					<span><h4b>Analysis and Planning:</h4b><p> We completed Stage 1 of Analysis and mostly finished the Planning as we investigate further the technological aspects for our app features. In parallel, we moved from previous low fidelity UI wireframing to medium wireframing. We anticipate that we could develop more specific technological details for mobile app development stage and progress to high fidelity UI/UX design. </p></span>
 					<center>
						<h2>
						</h2>
					</center>
					<span><h4b>UX & UI Design:</h4b><p>  We completed medium fidelity UI wireframing. Next will be high fidelity UI and start UX design. We should conduct A/B testing for our landing page optimization and A/B split testing for our call-to-action page during the UI development and not to wait until the pre-launch App Testing stage (Shewan 2021).  </p></span>
					<center>
						<h2>

					<span><h4b>Mobile App Development:</h4b><p> Software architects and programming for: </p></span>
					<ul>
						<li>Frontend featuring our preferred UI functions</li>
						<li>Backend to feature our preferred functions </li>
						<li>Backend to integrate various types of external advertising materials, possibly from ranging from simple string texts to images, video clips, and documents </li>
						<li>Backend to identify external materials’ metadata and keywords and sort to relevant users’ account according to their pre-selected categories and frontend to present to corresponding users </li>
						<li>Backend to integrate with database </li>
					</ul>
					<center>
						<h2>
						</h2>
					</center>
					<p>A Database expert will consider our data needs and advise on appropriate database system design, database hardware architecture, software and data backup strategies. Source SaaS service providers, hardware infrastructure requirement, data analytics to monitor data traffic and post-launch total quality management and crisis & recovery management plan, and structure costings for our mob app needs.</p>

					<p>Seek legal advice in privacy policies, liabilities limitations and terms and conditions for users of using our mob app, as well as business contracts to our prospective business vendors for supplying their product information/advertising campaigns.  </p>

					<p>Once our prototype artifact is ready, together with our preliminary market research for our app demand, the team needs to prepare appealing demonstrations, has a reliable launch date, and business planning with various business vendors for negotiating business opportunities.  </p>

					<p>Subject to the cost, we should also explore possible marketing campaign of our own to improve market awareness of our app and launching date and a post-launch data traffic analytics and research to evaluate the market penetration.  </p>
					 
					<center>
						<h2>
						</h2>
					</center>
					<span><h4b>Pre-Launch App Testing and Quality Assurance:</h4b><p>  Conduct time-limited cohort market research to try and test the functionality of the prototype app and reflect on the result and feedback to make essential uncomplicated modifications with software architect and programmers for the prototype version. Other feedback and suggestions from the app testing can be incorporated in future version. We should include data recovery and crisis plan as part of the app testing. </p></span>
					  
					<center>
						<h2>
						</h2>
					</center>
					<span><h4b>Ongoing maintenance and updates:</h4b><p>  Frequent regular data traffic analysis and feedback from users are key parts of ongoing maintenance, both from technical and business prospective. We should have some standard KPIs such as retention rate, click-thru-rate and conversion rate. </p></span>

						<b><h2>Week 5 Diary (14 Feb-20 Feb 2022)</h2></b>
					</center>
					<p>This week we focussed on ensuring the medium-fidelity UI was working smoothly, all known considerations for Smarter Gifter were made, report writing, website completed and presentation for A5 was ready for submission. </p>
