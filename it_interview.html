						<p>Scott has 15 years practical experience in the IT industry. He started his career repairing computers and quickly developed a passion for web design.  He realised that there was money to be made in hosting and now runs a web design and hosting company with allied hosting brands. He also runs his own servers, keeping them in a local data center in Sydney to provide a computing power resource service. </p>
						<p>Prior to COVID, Scott spent most of his time in an office environment and employed a small team of people. Over time, due to the pandemic and personal preference, he downsized his business and now works from home.  While he no longer works in a traditional team environment, he interacts closely with marketers and clients such as small business owners and operators. He suggested that while he does not have one boss, he reports to over 400 people who host on his servers. He also stays connected to the IT community and other professionals such as Windows support, data centre operators and experienced Industry peers, especially in the Linux community.  He suggested that the trickiest part of this arrangement was coordinating the other members of his household. </p>
						<p>His biggest career challenge is time management in all aspects of IT. Scott advised that staying active and healthy, and deciding between the things he was interested to learn versus the things he needed to learn to grow his business a constant balancing act.  He advised that, especially for people working from home, individuals need this balance and not to lose yourself in your work. He also indicated that spending too much money on RAM and equipment was a particular challenge of his.  </p>
						<p>Scott advised that regardless of the IT field we are interested in, learning business is imperative. Understanding how businesses work will make lead to better, more rounded, IT professionals.</p>
						<p>He recommended that we should study and work to our strengths and interests and get a broad perspective across many IT fields. He suggested leaning Linux as it will be the future of OS’s and become familiar with local area networks and wide area networks and understand the connections between computers. He recommended looking into YouTube tutorials (referencing Techno Tim) and learn how to tighten up security.</p>						
						<p>Scott is excited about the future of IT. He is looking forward to Nanotechnology and is amazed by its versatility. He is excited to see bigger processing, bigger RAM, and bigger storage. He is interested in the Blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens and finds new innovations and the changing IT environment exciting</p>
