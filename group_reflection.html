						<h2>SGT Peta-Maree BUBEAR</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Team Leader</h4>
						<h4>Canberra ACT, Ngunnawal Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>Maintaining our schedule of two meetings per week was suitable for information flow. We also instigated a live document where we could share our thoughts and research. It was great to have all of our information in one place.</p>  
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>Open, honest communication can always be improved upon. The implementation of a Team Leader much earlier in the project would have been extremely beneficial. 
							<br>It took several attempts for a team leader to be identified for A3 and A5, and I feel that this really slowed down the process and cohesion. But once identified we make quick progress.</p>  
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>How quickly the assignment was pulled together once information was known and researched. It never ceases to amaze me how quickly things come together in the last week or two. I am also incredibly impressed by our UI design and A5 presentation. 
							<br>It was slow to get started, but I feel that the product is incredibly professional. I am very proud of what we have achieved.</p>  
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>If there is an issue in the team, you need to speak up early. Unfortunately, we had a time critical decision to make. We collectively made the difficult decision with minimal delay, and it allowed us to move forward as a group.</p>

						<h2>Dr Stephen CHUNG</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher and Developer</h4>
						<h4> Sydney NSW, The Gadigal of the Eora Nation </h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>Learning from previous feedback, we decided on our A3 project idea and used MS Teams as our main tools. We checked A3 briefing often to align our thoughts and identified key areas to go in-depth. 
							<br>As we did so, we learnt more specific details, reflected on and made changes to our previous ideas and thoughts. 
							<br>A3 required early solid inputs from all team members to move forward from the conceptual phase, however, due to many constraints, we agreed the division of labour strategy, paired up and focused on different areas yet adhered to our timeline as we acknowledged that one depended on the other (for A5 as well).</p>
							<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>Brainstorming in Week1 for both functionalities and technical aspects of our project was not too successful. 
							<br>Everyone could put their ideas in the share document early on and used the meeting time for discussing pros and cons of ideas and decision making rather than sharing ideas. Inevitably, we changed some ideas/decisions as we progressed and learnt more.</p> 
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>Our mock-up mobile app pages were surprisingly high quality. Our initial Development Plan (based on logic) resembled to industrial standards.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>It takes time to develop a team culture.</p>

						<h2>Jacob DANIELS</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher and Developer</h4>
						<h4>Hobart TAS, Nipaluna Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>Splitting the groups into two helped tremendously with making sure everything could get done. Peta taking the lead again helped a lot to get everyone focused.</p> 
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>We had two team members that didn’t work out. I think the team did really well to pick up the slack from that, but it was still disappointing. 
							<br>Another thing is we started this project with no real leader to see who would step up, and the first couple weeks were wasted a little until we got on track.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>It was surprising how much one team member can disrupt a groups energy. Having an extra staff member that didn’t fit in well actually managed to slow the progress a significant amount.</p> 
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>More is not always better when it comes to a group.</p>

						<h2>David DENHOLM</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher, Developer and Mentor</h4>
						<h4>Perth WA, Whadjuk Noongar Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>The communication was good overall with a few minor hiccups. The team worked on assignments without issues. Brainstorming sessions gave some good insights into the project's future. 
							<br>We all agreed that seeing the project through to completion in our time constraints was impractical and we should focus on a good quality wireframe and researched project.</p>
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>While the quality of the meetings was good, the time in between those meetings had little communication or updates on progress between parties. The MS Teams task board was not updated by parties often.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>We had one team member join the group late and was surprisingly critical about a project she thought was a horrible idea. This made getting her on board to do any assigned tasks in the manor which we had all agreed prior difficult.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>We all have different opinions, and some are more willing to compromise than others. The key to a successful team is people open to the idea that someone else has a better idea.</p>

					<p>It was agreed by Phronesis Collective members that we remained committed to the assignment, actively contributed to meetings, and readily took on tasks and responsibilities. To successfully achieve the project deliverables in a timely fashion, the team was divided into roles and positions – working solidly on either A3 or A5 with plenty of collaboration in between. While this was not ideal, it was necessary to combat the compressed timeframes due to circumstances out of our control. </p>
					<p>Microsoft Teams was initially used as a central point for information collation. However, this was cast aside in favour of a live document saved amongst the Microsoft Teams files. This document was used by members as a place to brainstorm, discuss concepts and collate information. While it was useful to have all information in one place, the document became unwieldy and difficult to manage. It also ran the very real risk of corruption. If this was to occur, all of our assignment data would have be lost as there was no backup. In hindsight, backing up such important information should be a major consideration for any assignment. </p>
					<p>Unfortunately, a good portion of this assignment period was overshadowed by significant team conflict. Conflict resolution techniques and mitigations were trialled by Phronesis Collective members with no success. As a result, course leaders were required to intervene. Once the confliction was removed from the team, we came together relatively quickly to finalise the assignment. We also had one team member who was not contactable and did not participate in any group work for A3 and A5. While this was incredibly disappointing, we had risk managed this and built-in redundancies to manage around them.</p>
					<p>Phronesis Collective Git repository audit trail accurately reflects the progress made with the report. To expedite website management, one member took the lead and updated it in parallel to the report write-up. However, it is not a true representation of individual member’s contributions or performance towards the assignment.</p>
