						<b><h2>Security and Privacy</h2></b>
					</center>
						<p>The security of our customers information is imperative to Phronesis Collective. To make Smarter Gifter a reliable, secure, and trusted app, there are security elements that must be investigated and incorporated into the app design:</p>
						<span><p><b><p2>Write secure code – </p2></b>we must keep security in mind at every step of code creation and produce a code that cannot be reverse engineered. We will do this by using code hardening and code signing. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Encrypt the data - </p2></b>we must transform data from readable plain text data to jumbled ciphertext.  </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>User high - </p2></b>level authentication – We must build in a requirement for customers to use strong passwords or correctly answer obscure personal questions to gain entry to the application.  </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Age verification – </p2></b>as Smarter Gifter will not be recommending alcohol, tobacco, or adult paraphernalia, nor will it have the ability for individual users to communicate through the app, age verification is not required at this time. However, it is something that must be considered should Smarter Gifter expand into these territories. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Alias and Avatar Name - </p2></b>As Smarter Gifter will use Usernames (Aliases) and Avatars, we can avoid holding confidential user information.</p></span>

						<b><h2>Financial Analysis</h2></b>
					</center>
					<center>
						<h4>Costing, Marketing and Revenue</h4>
					</center>
						<p>In 2021, the cost of developing a basic mobile app was US $38K-91K, and for a medium complexity app it was US $50K-120K (Addevice). The average time required to develop a mobile app is ~6mths. <br>
						Based on the latest figures available from Addevice and anticipating the Smarter Gifter prototype is a simple-medium complexity, the estimated costing is US $90,000-$95,000.
</p>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
						<h4b>Amazon Web Services provided us with an online estimate. <br>
						This quote was approximately US $12,755 per month (US $153,058 per year) and includes Mobile App Development such as: </h4b>
						</center>
							<ul>
								<li>Database setup</li>
								<li>Storage</li>
								<li>Backup and recovery management plan</li>
								<li>Data encryption </li>
								<li>Data analytics and performance management</li>
								<li>Ongoing maintenance</li>
							</ul>
						
						<h2></h2>
						
						<p>We would discuss with the service provider to scale down or minimize some services to initially lower the costs.  <br>
						For example, we may separate and store users profile details (legal name, contact number and email address) as structured data, which will be a few kb .csv file each, in minimum SQL server database, from MongoDB for unstructured data type. </p>

						<p>As the total cost subjects to the total development hours and hourly rate, based on Addevice 2021 data, the following is our estimates of our app’s development plan. </p>

						<h4b>Market Positioning and Revenue</h4b>
						<p>We considered two potential sources of revenue: users and business vendors. </p>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h4b>Users</h4b>						
						<p>To develop consumer confidence and encourage initial downloads, we would initially offer Smarter Gifter as a free mobile app. We will consider the option of graded or premium membership to access advanced features in future app development. </p>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
						<h4b>If we assume that:</h4b>
						<p> The minimal operating cost was AU $200K per year <br>
						+ <br>
						The average successful purchase/transaction was AU $30 <br>
						+ <br>
						Business vendors agreed to pay 0.5% of transaction price as our commission <br>
						= <br>
						Smarter Gifter would need 1,333,333 transactions per year (25,641 per week) to break even.
						</p>
						<h2></h2>

						<h2></h2>
							
							
						<h4b>Business Vendors </h4b>
						<p>We analyzed the current online digital media marketing model. The key market leader is Google-based platforms including Chrome and YouTube. Google uses algorithms to analyze individual’s pattern and business vendors can bid for the keywords to target prospective customer. Google also assesses the quality of business vendors’ corresponding landing pages to determine a quality score, together with other business ethics, to determine a pricing for business vendors (Thompson 2021). </p>
						<p>Business vendors’ online (visual) ad campaign (PPC) spent an estimated US $90K–120K per year, an average of US $1-2 per click, paid to media platforms like Google (Zweig 2016). </p>
						<p>Considering Smarter Gifter is a new digital online platform, our customer base will become a good impression to business vendors. As vendors have developed their online advertising campaigns for other platforms, we could attract these vendors to use Smarter Gifter as well and negotiate commissions on successful transactions via the app. </p>
						<p>We could also consider earning-per-click from business vendors. At present, earning-per-click is not common mainstream, as there are limited numbers of websites that people earn money to click ads, average EUR €0.001–0.005 per click (wad.ojooo.com). The revenue from this would be minimal and insignificant to both us and our users. </p>

						<b><h2>Risk Management</h2></b>
					</center>
					
					
						
						<p>There are several risks that we have considered for Smarter Gifter. These can be classified as either an internal risk (within our reasonable control) or an external risk (out of our control):</p>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h4b>Internal Risks</h4b>
						<span><p><b><p2>Software and hardware issues - </p2></b> Wireframing, UI, video editing software and middleware may be easier or harder to use than anticipated. We may need to either scale-back or invest more time into managing software and hardware.</p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Database knowledge - </p2></b> We are developing our skills and knowledge in database design, database management, software, and back-up and crisis planning. We will need to rely on recruiting database expertise and/or SaaS cloud services provider. As we intend to outsource to SaaS cloud services provider, we will need to understand the risks of their services. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Customer and Technical Support - </p2></b> We plan to have customer support and technicians available to our team to provide relevant support to users. We also plan to have a business manager to assist business vendors. </p></span>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h4b>External Risks</h4b>
						<p>External risks are more difficult to predict when and where they will occur. We certainly acknowledge that these risks are present in Smart Gifter creation and running, and will endeavour to eliminate or mitigate where possible:</p>
							<ul>
								
								<li>Cyberattack/security breach </li>
								<li>Users distributing/sharing their giftees private info without consent  </li>
								<li>Fake/scam/phishing vendors  </li>
								<li>Fake/scam/phishing materials  </li>
								<li>Business vendors abuse our service/app  </li>
								<li>Age-inappropriate content/link hidden in vendors’ advertising materials  </li>
								<li>Fake user identity  </li>
								<li>Legal matters – infringing our copyright/IP, being sued for alleged infringing others’ IP  </li>
								<li>Fake email/contact in Phronesis Collective name  </li>
							</ul>
