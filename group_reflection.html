		<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
		<p>Towards the end of a project, it is important for team members to examine their individual thoughts and feelings and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Phronesis Collective took a moment away from the group work to individually reflect on how well we worked as a group and provide their own perspective of the experience.</p>

						<h2>SGT Peta-Maree BUBEAR</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Team Leader</h4>
						<h4>Canberra ACT, Ngunnawal Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>Scheduling two meetings a week worked well as it ensured that all team members were able to attend. Having an easy-to-read agenda allowed all the important points to be met and for the conversation to flow.</p>  
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>Open, honest communication can always be improved upon. Members need to be accountable for absences and advise if they are planning to be away from group work. Alternately, emergencies arise, they should check in once practicable. Members should also practice being out of their comfort zone and try new things or seek guidance and support from their team members when they are unsure.   
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>How well we worked as a team, especially around potential areas of conflict.  On occasion some members misinterpreted the assignment brief. Instead of a dispute arising, all members were given the opportunity to provide their interpretation and a collective decision was made.</p>  
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>To expect the unexpected and always have a contingency plan in place to redistribute workload etc, in the event of an emergency with a team member.</p>

						<h2>Dr Stephen CHUNG</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher and Developer</h4>
						<h4> Sydney NSW, The Gadigal of the Eora Nation </h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>All group members are enthusiastic and motivated, so all volunteered early on to take and share roles and responsibilities. All appreciate each other’s life commitment, and all tried to work out things best fit for everyone. We all also committed to follow up with recordings if absent from the meetings and fulfilled their assigned tasks. Peta has very kindly volunteered, and supported by all, to be our leader, and she did fantastic job, especially using MS Teams tasks to create and lay out all sections of A2 in different buckets. David has also very skilfully and efficiently set up our group’s GitHub repo so to keep building it up as we go. In my opinion, these two things truly set the important cornerstone to successfully meet our timeline.</p>
							<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>At early stage, our group had 2 non-responding students. If it was made clear that it would be each student’s responsibility to at least remove themselves, if they have chosen a group, when they decided to quit.</p> 
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>I am using Microsoft Teams now, but not all web browsers support all features.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>Groups take time to establish stability and trust, and someone needs to put some effort to achieve same.</p>

						<h2>Jacob DANIELS</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher and Developer</h4>
						<h4>Hobart TAS, Nipaluna Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>The team dynamic worked well. Peta really stepped up as a leader and put in an enormous amount of work setting up teams, planner, and the meetings. That really helped us to stay afloat and not stress out about how much work was remaining. David’s GitHub knowledge as well as HTML/CSS has also been amazing.</p> 
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>I struggled to balance this with my other course, so did not have a lot to contribute. This is no fault of the teams, but my own for not putting my hand up more. So, moving forward in future projects I will be taking on a lot more work.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>It was surprising how driven everyone was in this group. In other study groups I have been in it has always been a nightmare trying to get a team to participate, but this group was the complete opposite.</p> 
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>Having one person step up and schedule meetings and tasks is essential to a functioning team.</p>

						<h2>David DENHOLM</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher, Developer and Mentor</h4>
						<h4>Perth WA, Whadjuk Noongar Country</h4>
						<h4>What went well?</h4>
							<p>The meeting schedule twice weekly meant all members could make at least one meeting per week. Everyone was open and honest about ideas and opinions, even if they disagreed about something, and this was taken on board. Peta was incredibly organised with tasks and timelines; her leadership was a huge asset.</p>
						<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
							<p>Communication over the holidays with other commitments made the task progress a little slower than I’d have liked. I would have liked to see more members try their hands at website design a little more.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that was surprising?</h4>
							<p>I was quite surprised with the ranges of experience and everyone’s backgrounds.</p>
						<h4>What is at least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>
							<p>While I hadn’t learned it here, Plan for the worst, hope for the best. Always have a backup plan in case someone is unable to complete the assigned tasks.</p>

		<h2>Group Reflection </h2>
		</center>
		<div id="techReport2">
			<section>
				<article>					
					<p>It was agreed by all Phronesis Collective members that, as a collective, we were committed to the assignment, actively contributed to meetings, and readily took on tasks and responsibilities.</p>
					<p>Initially, Microsoft Teams was a challenge for some members, but with support and encouragement from the experienced team members, became comfortable and active users. </p>
					<p>GitHub, CSS and HTML was another area that some members struggled with. Fortunately, there was a strong mentor in the group who took actively lead of website creation and methodically updated it as information was provided.  He made himself available for questions and patiently talked members though their mistakes and concerns in the live environment.  </p>
					<p>Many members considered there was areas for improvement regarding open and honest communication. As the team became more established, trust began to form. We anticipate that this trust will continue to grow as the assignments progress. </p>
					<p>Conflict was often mitigated through discussion on the topic. Occasionally, individual members misinterpreted the assignment brief. After group discussion and consideration, an outcome was agreed to, and we moved on. As members consistently contributed to meetings and to the group chat, it allowed for opinions and ideas to flow and creativity to take hold.</p>
					<p>Phronesis Collective Git repository audit trail accurately reflects the progress made with the report. The website was developed parallel to the written report element. This can be demonstrated in the audit trail.  However, it is not a true representation of individual members contributions or performance towards the assignment. While each member contributed something to the repository, it should be noted that some members require further practice and development in this space. Much of the website development was finalised by the website mentor, with other members contributing based on their experience and comfort levels.</p>
