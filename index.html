						<h2>Dr Stephen CHUNG</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Financial Analyst, Online Researcher and UI Designer</h4>
						<h4> Sydney NSW, The Gadigal of the Eora Nation </h4>
							<p>Stephen is a practicing medical specialist and has been a senior consultant physician in rehabilitation medicine for over 15 years. He graduated with a Masters in Health Admin at UNSW, and further studied pain medicine and management with assistive equipment and technology for patients with impairments and disabilities. He is also a licensed real estate agent and an auctioneer.</p>
							<p>Stephen enjoys sports such as squash, table tennis, badminton, and snow skiing. He speaks fluent Cantonese, and his latest hobby is his veggie patch. Stephen’s curiosity in IT stemmed from early interest in personal computing and computer language BASIC. When he got a Hotmail email address in the 90s he wondered how the ‘www’ would change the future. </p>
							<p>In his rehabilitation medical practice, Stephen is exposed to pioneering healthcare technology. He has researched the use of interactive computer assistive technology such as Nintendo Wii and XBOX for patient therapy and is changing to Makey Makey with an adapted user interface to suit patient abilities. Stephen is looking forward to further exploring user interface enhancements in the IT industry for patient cohort.</p>
							<p>Stephens ideal job as a UX Designer focuses on design-engineering human-interface products or devices to be easy to use and understand by the targeted cohort. The concept of user-centred design becomes the paradigm in UX design process. It starts with developing user persona, which is researching the user cohort to gain understandings and identifying exactly their needs and wants from the prospective products. Such human-interface/interaction is not limited to tangible devices but encompasses various human senses, including psychological and emotional reactions. Hence, UX designing is a multi-disciplinary specialty, and UX designers interact with all team members throughout the development process, ranging from market research to conceptualization of products, to protocol testing, and post-marketing analysis.</p>

						<h2>Ben TANNER</h2>
						<h4>Phronesis Collective Researcher and Developer</h4>
						<h4>Regional NSW</h4>
							<p>Ben's career for the last 15 years has been in cooking and is a qualified chef. Ben's hobbies were in gaming, World of Warcraft, League of Legends, mobile games and a card game called Magic: The Gathering. Currently Ben has no active hobbies.</p>
							<p>Ben has always been interested in IT due to its flexibility in what you can do with it as a career. His main interests in IT were gaming and he would still like to investigate it, but now it more along the lines of robotics. Ben studied electronics in High school and built his own robot and have always wanted to go back to it. Ben has not had much exposure to IT besides friends, games and building his own PC.</p>
							<p>Ben’s ideal job as a Robotics Engineer designs, constructs and tests mechanical machines (robots) that move or function as a human. Some robots are designed to be human-like but are made to do things we cannot, such as jobs that would be too dangerous for humans to attempt. Robotics touches on a variety of fields such as medical, maintenance, travel, safety, and education.  The purpose is to improve on what we can already do whether it be by doing it longer, faster, more accurately or consistently by making them specific to on one task or multiple. They are normally working in a lab or workshop with 3D computer-aided design tools (CAD), and computer-aided manufacturing tools (CAM) to physical make them.</p>

					<p>Understanding how people think, feel, learn, and communicate allows employers fit employees to teams, understand what individual members require to be efficient, and ensure that meaningful work is distributed accordingly. 
					<br>A cheap and time-effective way to receive this information during the formative days of team creation is through personality tests such as Myers-Briggs or learning style tests. </p>
					
					<p>Phronesis Collective have a diverse range of scores personality test scores. There is an even mixture of assertiveness, leadership/followership, intuitiveness, and creativity. 
					<br>As individuals we learn, think and handle stress differently. 
					<br>We are from diverse backgrounds and regions throughout Australia that have come together to achieve a common goal. 
					<br>Should conflict resolution techniques be required, we should look to adapt our communication style to best suit the team member. 
					<br>We can obtain clues on how to achieve this through the personality test results provided.  </p>  
					
					<p>While group diversity is a benefit in creative thinking and problem solving, conflict is bound to arise. 
					<br>Understanding how the team members of Phronesis Collective think and interpret information in useful in warding off conflict and getting the most from all individuals and the team.

					<p>It was agreed by all Phronesis Collective members that we were committed to A2. We all actively contributed to meetings and tasks, readily taking on responsibilities as required. 
					<br>We performed solidly for the duration and consistently looked for ways to take our Project Plan to the next step. 
					<br>We actively engaged conflict management methods and mitigations before significant issue arose, sought out personal strengths and began to develop individual weaknesses.  </p>
					
					<p>After receiving pleasing feedback and scores for A2, Phronesis Collective is more determined than ever to get the best out of our individual learnings and implement them into A3 and A5.

					<p>There are many similarities and differences that can be seen in our desired jobs and associated career plans. 
					<br>Soft skills such as excellent communication, ability to work under pressure, attention to detail, teamwork and problem-solving skills feature heavily through the IT industry. 
					<br>While each role requires some knowledge of programming and computing experience, they are all different in their individual requirements. </p>
					
					<p>Some of the skills our group required are also in high demand, such as SQL, NoSQL, Javascript, while a few of our required skills are not in high demand, probably because these skills are prerequisite skills we yet to attain. 
					<br>This also outlined skill gaps in the industry and is worthwhile for our group to consider developing and attaining.
					<br>One important lesson learnt is that we should know well of those commonly known skills and then aim to develop in a few specialized fields.</p>
					
					<center>
						<h2></h2>
					</center>
					<p>While many of the skills and experiences are the same for each role, there are differing educational prerequisites to get into our chosen professions:</p>
					<b><h4a>Peta’s ideal job as a Data Scientist.</h4a></b> <p>This is a large sector. To become a Data Scientist, she must first have a bachelor's degree in computer science or related degree, focussing on Statistics (Inferential and Descriptive Statistics) and Mathematics (Linea Algebra and Calculus). </p>					
					<b><h4a>Stephen’s ideal job is as a UI/UX Designer.</h4a></b>  <p> As Stephen explored how to do wireframing for UI design for this project, he took a 5-Day online UI Design Short Course with CareerFoundry (CareerFoundry 2022) and exploited his new skills to start wireframe designs for Smarter Gifter. Stephen is looking forward to taking Digital Design 1 and UX Design 2 in his elective courses in the near future. Stephen may also consider completing a Graduate Certificate of UX and Web Design (SEEK 2022). </p>
					<b><h4a>Jacob’s ideal job as a Software Developer.</h4a></b>  <p> To achieve this, he must have a bachelor's degree in computer science or related degree and must be a full-stack developer and understand concepts of software engineering (Beterteam 2022). </p>
					<b><h4a>David’s ideal job would be in tech support and a game developer.<h4a></b>  <p> It would be common for game companies to require a Bachelor’s degree, but this is typically a negotiable element if the candidate has job experience (Bay 2022). </p>					
					<b><h4a>Ben’s ideal job is Robotics Engineer.</h4a></b>  <p> For this job he will require a degree in automation, mechanical, robotics, or electrical engineering (Beterteam 2022). </p>
