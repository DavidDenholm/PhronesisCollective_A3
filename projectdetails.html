						<b><h2>Tools and Technology</h2></b>
					</center>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>The Requirements </h4b>
						</center>
						<span><p>To achieve <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b>, there are several software elements and tools that we must obtain. 
						<br>We need to also consider what language, integrated development environment (IDE) and database will be required for <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> to be up and running. </p></span>
						
						<p>Phronesis Collective determined that our immediate requirements to initially establish the project include: </p>
						<h4b>Software: </h4b>
							<ul>
								<li>Xamarin (License required) </li>
								<li>Wireframe design </li>
								<li>Graphic design </li>
								<li>Project management  </li>
							</ul>
							
						<h4b>Tools: </h4b>
							<ul>
								<li>Servers for database</li>
								<li>Communication tools (MS Teams) </li>
								<li>Gantt chart builder </li>
								<li>Resource planner </li>
								<li>Workflow manager </li>
								<li>Management tools </li>
								<li>Analytics and reporting tools </li>
								<li>Timeline and schedule builder </li>
								<li>Budget management </li>
								<li>File sharing and file manager </li>
								<li>Work management </li>
							</ul>
							
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>The Language</h4b>
						</center>
						
						<span><p>Early in the <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> concept phase we were considered using Kotlin as our programming language as it is open source and the official language for Android applications (Casey 2020). However, after some research and consideration, we agreed that C++ is our preferred programming language as it is the primary language used within the mobile industry (EDUCBA 2020). This language, best suited to Android OS, iOS, and Windows, has a high-performance server and is supported by Windows and Mac OS. </p></span>
						
							
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>The IDE</h4b>
						</center>
						
						<p>We would be looking at a relevant Integrated Development Environment in which to write the code. We would consider Xamarin as it appears to be the most common integrated environment developed for iOS, Android, and Windows. </p>
							
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>Purchasing Data</h4b>
						</center>
						<span><p>As <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> gains traction with users, we will look to expand operations by purchasing personal data through Google. It is anticipated that <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> will link with members Google accounts and refine gift suggestions based on their algorithms and personalised Google advertisements. </p></span>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>The DBMS</h4b>
						</center>
						<span><p>As a junior team, we have limited knowledge in database and database management system (DBMS) and considered a traditional relational database system using Microsoft SQL Server. 
						</p><p>As we develop our understanding of various database designs for different data types, and as <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> evolves to include advertising materials of unstructured data types such as images, URL links, and e-catalogues, we may need No-SQL DBMS such as MongoDB. MongoDB more common and used widely, cross-platforms, and supports major programming languages and development environments (MongoDB, Inc. 2021). </p></span>
						<h4b>This would include:</h4b>
							<ul>
								<li>unique user/vendor number </li>
								<li>username/vendor name </li>
								<li>contact details (email address, phone number) </li>
								<li>ABN, etc. </li>
							</ul>
							
						<p>Additionally, we would include a NoSQL database for advertising content, and only the unique user number and unique vendor number will cross between two database systems. The potential benefits would include a smaller database, reduced SQL costs and backup, recovery and security convenience. NoSQL database would capture and store user clicks and transactions. </p>
						<p>To achieve this, we would consult a database expert to advise and consider if hybrid MS SQL Server and MongoDB would suit our needs. We also need to capture traffic statistics for data analysis that may support our business case and modelling.  </p>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>Further Considerations</h4b>
						</center>
						
						<p>Database and DBMS can separate a basic users profile and recipient profile as structured data in relational DBMS, for example Microsoft SQL Server. In this case, any images will stay in the users physical device. They will not be able to see the images if thy log on to another device. </p>
						<span><p>If <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> took the route of storing images, include pop-up advertising, conduct data analytics, this unstructured data will need NoSQL DBMS, for example MongoDB. It is not ideal to have two separate databases and we consult a database expert to consider hybrid MS SQL Server and MongoDB.</p>
						<p>To help build a convincing business case for funding and negotiation with vendors, download/usage/view count will be the most used statistics in the early stages of <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b>. Once on the market, statistics of user clicking URLs, and even better, successful transactions will be stronger data to secure funding.</p></span>

						<b><h2>Security and Privacy</h2></b>
					</center>
						<h2></h2>
						<span><p>The security of our customers information is imperative to Phronesis Collective. To make <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> a reliable, secure, and trusted app, there are security elements that must be investigated and incorporated into the app design:</p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Write secure code – </p2></b>we must keep security in mind at every step of code creation and produce a code that cannot be reverse engineered. We will do this by using code hardening and code signing. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Encrypt the data - </p2></b>we must transform data from readable plain text data to jumbled ciphertext.  </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>User high - </p2></b>level authentication – We must build in a requirement for customers to use strong passwords or correctly answer obscure personal questions to gain entry to the application.  </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Age verification – </p2></b>as <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> will not be recommending alcohol, tobacco, or adult paraphernalia, nor will it have the ability for individual users to communicate through the app, age verification is not required at this time. However, it is something that must be considered should <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> expand into these territories. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Alias and Avatar Name - </p2></b>As <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> will use Usernames (Aliases) and Avatars, we can avoid holding confidential user information.</p></span>

						<b><h2>Financial Analysis</h2></b>
					</center>
						<h2></h2>
					<center>
						<h4>Costing, Marketing and Revenue</h4>
					</center>
						<span><p>In 2021, the cost of developing a basic mobile app was US $38K-91K, and for a medium complexity app it was US $50K-120K (Addevice). The average time required to develop a mobile app is ~6mths. <br>
						Based on the latest figures available from Addevice and anticipating the <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> prototype is a simple-medium complexity, the estimated costing is US $90,000-$95,000</p></span>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
						<h4b>Amazon Web Services provided us with an online estimate. <br>
						This quote was approximately US $12,755 per month (US $153,058 per year) and includes Mobile App Development such as: </h4b>
						</center>
							<ul>
								<li>Database setup</li>
								<li>Storage</li>
								<li>Backup and recovery management plan</li>
								<li>Data encryption </li>
								<li>Data analytics and performance management</li>
								<li>Ongoing maintenance</li>
							</ul>
						
						<h2></h2>
						
						<p>We would discuss with the service provider to scale down or minimize some services to initially lower the costs.  <br>
						For example, we may separate and store users profile details (legal name, contact number and email address) as structured data, which will be a few kb .csv file each, in minimum SQL server database, from MongoDB for unstructured data type. </p>

						<center>
							<h4b>Market Positioning and Revenue</h4b>
						</center>
						<p>We considered two potential sources of revenue: users and business vendors. </p>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>Users</h4b>	
						</center>				
						<span><p>To develop consumer confidence and encourage initial downloads, we would initially offer <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> as a free mobile app. We will consider the option of graded or premium membership to access advanced features in future app development. </p></span>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
						<h4b>If we assume that:</h4b>
						<p> The minimal operating cost was AU $200K per year <br>
						+ <br>
						The average successful purchase/transaction was AU $30 <br>
						+ <br>
						Business vendors agreed to pay 0.5% of transaction price as our commission <br>
						= <br>
						<span><b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> would need 1,333,333 transactions per year (25,641 per week) to break even.</p></span>
						<h2></h2>
						</center>
						<h2></h2>
							
							
						<center>
							<h4b>Business Vendors </h4b>
						</center>
						<p>We analyzed the current online digital media marketing model. The key market leader is Google-based platforms including Chrome and YouTube. Google uses algorithms to analyze individual’s pattern and business vendors can bid for the keywords to target prospective customer. Google also assesses the quality of business vendors’ corresponding landing pages to determine a quality score, together with other business ethics, to determine a pricing for business vendors (Thompson 2021). </p>
						<p>Business vendors’ online (visual) ad campaign (PPC) spent an estimated US $90K–120K per year, an average of US $1-2 per click, paid to media platforms like Google (Zweig 2016). </p>
						<span><p>Considering <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> is a new digital online platform, our customer base will become a good impression to business vendors. As vendors have developed their online advertising campaigns for other platforms, we could attract these vendors to use <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> as well and negotiate commissions on successful transactions via the app. </p></span>
						<p>We could also consider earning-per-click from business vendors. At present, earning-per-click is not common mainstream, as there are limited numbers of websites that people earn money to click ads, average EUR €0.001–0.005 per click (wad.ojooo.com). The revenue from this would be minimal and insignificant to both us and our users. </p>

						<b><h2>Risk Management</h2></b>
					</center>
						<h2></h2>
					
					
						
						<span><p>There are several risks that we have considered for <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b>. These can be classified as either an internal risk (within our reasonable control) or an external risk (out of our control):</p></span>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>Internal Risks</h4b>
						</center>
						<span><p><b><p2>Software and hardware issues - </p2></b> Wireframing, UI, video editing software and middleware may be easier or harder to use than anticipated. We may need to either scale-back or invest more time into managing software and hardware.</p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Database knowledge - </p2></b> We are developing our skills and knowledge in database design, database management, software, and back-up and crisis planning. We will need to rely on recruiting database expertise and/or SaaS cloud services provider. As we intend to outsource to SaaS cloud services provider, we will need to understand the risks of their services. </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Customer and Technical Support - </p2></b> We plan to have customer support and technicians available to our team to provide relevant support to users. We also plan to have a business manager to assist business vendors. </p></span>
						
						<h2></h2>
						<h2></h2>
						<center>
							<h4b>External Risks</h4b>
						</center>
						<p>External risks are more difficult to predict when and where they will occur. We certainly acknowledge that these risks are present in Smart Gifter creation and running, and will endeavour to eliminate or mitigate where possible:</p>
							<ul>
								
								<li>Cyberattack/security breach </li>
								<li>Users distributing/sharing their giftees private info without consent  </li>
								<li>Fake/scam/phishing vendors  </li>
								<li>Fake/scam/phishing materials  </li>
								<li>Business vendors abuse our service/app  </li>
								<li>Age-inappropriate content/link hidden in vendors’ advertising materials  </li>
								<li>Fake user identity  </li>
								<li>Legal matters – infringing our copyright/IP, being sued for alleged infringing others’ IP  </li>
								<li>Fake email/contact in Phronesis Collective name  </li>
							</ul>
