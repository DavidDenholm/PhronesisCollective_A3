						<b><h2>Motivation</h2></b>
					</center>
						<p>At Phronesis Collective, we have created an app that will streamline the tracking of occasions and the purchasing of gifts for loved ones. Those who find gift purchasing a daunting task will readily welcome <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b>. </p></span>
						<p>Conventional advertising can render buyers overwhelmed by choice. This often leads to distraction, loss of focus, and a risk of the overspending, impulse buying or last-minute shopping.  </p>
						<p>‘38% of US consumers say that guessing what people want is their greatest annoyance when shopping for presents’ (Emarsys 2021). Such is the issue with the gift giving roulette, that Australian retailer Myer created an entire 2021 advertisement campaign surrounding it. Titled Unriddle Christmas, Myer (2021) explores the dreaded anxiety around ensuring you give the perfect gift to the ones you love. </p>

						<h4b>A survey of 50 people told us that deciding on the perfect gift and the chaos of the shops were their biggest stressors at Christmas time.</h4b>

						<span><p><b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> aligns with current mobile commerce trends that conclude more people use smartphones to make online transactions. Statistical data revealed that 79% of smartphone users in the U.S. used their smartphones to make a purchase in the last six months, and 1/3 of all e-commerce sales in last year’s holiday shopping season were made using smartphones. (Smith, J., OuterBox 2022). </p>

						<b><h2>Landscape</h2></b>
					</center>
						<p>There are many family-orientated calendars and gifting apps on the market that aim to keep loved ones organised and connected. Most of these applications host collaboration features, calendars, lists, and schedules that the user can update and personalise. Some of our potential competitors include:</p>
						<span><p><b><p2>Christmas Gift List - </p2></b> An app specifically for Christmas gift purchases. The app allows users to track gift ideas by entering them in the app. Users can set a budget for each user and mark the gift off their list once the user has purchased it. On 01 January every year, lists will be archived and a new list with existing people will be generated automatically (engApps 2022).</p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>Family Shared Calendar - </p2></b>A shared family schedule that allows users to share calendars, lists, notes, and assign tasks through Android and IOS devices. Information is shared through the app using one account with multiple users. Users utilise their own email address and a shared password (Beesoft Apps 2022).  </p></span>
						<span><p><b><p2>GiftPlanner - </p2></b> A gift list and organiser that allows the user to keep track of gift list and events. Users can update their planned gift information, preferred stores, purchase statuses (including the order and tracking details). The app also allows users to browse the internet and save links directly to their app lists without the need to close the internet and open the app (Milham 2021). </p></span>

						<p>We analysed the e-commence and m-commence markets and witnessed algorithm-based push-advertising by sellers. While some users enjoy watching pop-up advertisements and emails related to recent search of their interests, many others feel overwhelmed and information overloaded, if not annoyed, by such “predictive” marketing. </p>
